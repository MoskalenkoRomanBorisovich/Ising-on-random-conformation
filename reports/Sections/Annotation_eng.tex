\section*{Abstract}
Ising model is a relatively new model used to determine magnetic properties of materials and objects. In this work we study properties of Ising model on ensembles of conformations. Conformation is a random walk on a regular grid witch can represent a molecule. Structure of the conformation depends on the temperature. And other studies has shown that conformations have a geometric phase transition. Two states of conformation at low and high temperatures are called globule and coil respectively. Geometrically globule and coil conformations are similar to one and two dimensional grids. As most vertexes in globules have 4 neighbors and in coils they mostly have 2. It was proven that on one-dimensional grid Ising model has no magnetic phase transition. Our hypothesis is that globular conformations have magnetic phase transition. But on two-dimensional grid it phase transition exists. The goal of this research is to determine the magnetic phase transition point in globular conformations and compare it to the point of geometric phase transition in conformations.
