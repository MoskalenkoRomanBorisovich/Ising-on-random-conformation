\section*{Abstract}

This paper studies magnetic properties of the Ising model on ensembles of conformations.
This work focuses on the relationship between the structural properties of conformations and the magnetic properties of the Ising model built on conformations. In particular, the effect of a geometric phase transition on the appearance of a magnetic transition. Since at low temperatures the structure of conformations is similar to a two-dimensional lattice, and it is known that the Ising model on a two-dimensional lattice has a phase transition. And at high temperatures, the conformations are similar to a one-dimensional lattice, on which there is no transition in the Ising model.
In other works in this field, the spin subsystem of the Ising model and the conformation structure change simultaneously, but this considers a model with frozen disorder. Thus, in our model, the conformation is first generated, and then the Ising model is considered with a fixed geometry.
The results of the work are: the magnetic properties of conformations in each of the phases, the magnetic transition point in the globular phase, the change in the magnetic properties of conformations during a geometric phase transition, the influence of structural features of conformations on their magnetic properties.
